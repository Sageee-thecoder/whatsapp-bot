## Usage

2. Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp app:

## Important Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è This bot is for educational and legitimate automation purposes only
- üì± Keep your phone connected to the internet for the bot to work

## Customization

You can easily add more commands by modifying the `switch` statement in `bot.js`. Examples:

```javascript
case '/custom':
    await message.reply('Your custom response here!');
    break;
```
